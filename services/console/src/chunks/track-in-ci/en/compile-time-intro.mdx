Compile times can be a significant part of your build time, especially in {props.lang}.
[Continuous Benchmarking][continuous benchmarking] is the practice of running benchmarks on every changeset to ensure the changes do not introduce a performance regressions.
You can treat compile times as a benchmark and track them in CI to catch slow compile times.
The easiest way to implement Continuous Benchmarking for {props.lang} compile times is to use Bencher.
