Binary sizes can get bloated over time, especially in {props.lang}.
[Continuous Benchmarking][continuous benchmarking] is the practice of running benchmarks on every changeset to ensure the changes do not introduce a performance regressions.
You can treat binary sizes as a benchmark and track them in CI to catch large binary sizes.
The easiest way to implement Continuous Benchmarking for {props.lang} binary sizes is to use Bencher.
