### `--native-tls`

<br />

Optional: Load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, `bencher` loads certificates from the bundled [`webpki-roots` crate][webpki-roots].
The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla,
and including them in `bencher` improves portability and performance.
This is especially true on macOS, where reading the system trust store incurs a significant delay.

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store,
especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root that's included in your system's certificate store
for a mandatory proxy or self-signed Bencher Self-Hosted connections.
