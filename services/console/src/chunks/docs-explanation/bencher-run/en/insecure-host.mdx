### `--insecure-host`

<br />

Optional: Allow insecure connection to Bencher API server.

This flag is useful when you're connecting to a Bencher Self-Hosted instance
with a self-signed certificate or a certificate that's not included in the system's certificate store.
It is only applicable to HTTPS connections, as HTTP connections are inherently insecure.

**WARNING**: Only use `--insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources,
as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to [man-in-the-middle attacks][wikipedia mitm].
