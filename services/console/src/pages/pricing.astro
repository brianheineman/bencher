                  Bencher Bare Metal delivers bare metal continuous benchmarking servers as a service (CBaaS).
                  These servers are tuned by performance experts to eliminate noise and get wall-clock time variance to less than 1%!
                  Take your performance engineering to the next level

              What is a Metric?

            </h3>
            <p>
              A Metric is a single, point-in-time benchmark result.
              Each time a benchmark is run, it creates at least one new Metric.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if you have <code>5</code> benchmarks that measure latency
              then they would create <code>5</code> Metrics each time they run.
              If you ran your benchmarks <code>10</code> times,
              you would then have <code>50</code> Metrics:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>5</code> benchmarks x <code>10</code> runs = <code>50</code> Metrics
            </p>
            <p>
              Even if your benchmark harness runs your benchmarks 1,000 times to get a more accurate result,
              you would still only have <code>50</code> Metrics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some benchmarks may create more than one new Metric per run.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if you have <code>5</code> benchmarks that each have <code>2</code> measures, latency and throughput,
              then they would create <code>10</code> Metrics each time they run.
              If you ran your benchmarks <code>10</code> times,
              you would then have <code>100</code> Metrics:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>5</code> benchmarks x <code>2</code> measures x <code>10</code> runs = <code>100</code> Metrics

              How are Metrics billed?

            </h3>
            <p>
              On Bencher Cloud, Metrics are billed either:
              <ul>
                <li>Monthly based on metered usage</li>
                <li>Annually based on a licensed quantity</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if you create <code>5,280</code> Metrics in a particular calendar
              month with metered usage then you would be billed for <code>5,280</code> Metrics that month.
            </p>
            <p>
							Bencher Self-Hosted Metrics are always billed annually based on a licensed quantity.
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, if you create <code>5,280</code> Metrics within a given year,
              then you would need to have a licensed quantity of say <code>6,000</code> Metrics.

              You can use Bencher Self-Hosted in development, testing, and production without a Bencher Plus license.
              This is equivalent to using Bencher Cloud on the Free plan.
              If you would like access to any of the Bencher Plus features (Team or Enterprise),
              then you will need to purchase a Bencher Plus license.

            <li>
              When a feature is open source we won't move that feature to a paid
              tier. Features might be removed from the open source codebase in
              other cases, for example when combining features from multiple
              tiers into one new feature. To be clear, this promise only applies
              to open sourced features, features in paid tiers might move to a
              higher tier.

            <li>
              We won't introduce features into the open source codebase with a

            </li>
            <li>
              We will always release and open source all tests that we have for

              The open source codebase will have all the essential features for

            proxies for usage (e.g., number of users in a project) as we seek to
            optimize costs and revenues.
